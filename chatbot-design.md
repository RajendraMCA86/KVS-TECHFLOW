# Chatbot Design: Nexus

This document outlines the complete design, conversational script, and logic for Nexus, a lead-generating chatbot for a technology services company website.

### **1. Chatbot Persona: "Nexus"**

*   **Role:** A smart, efficient, and professional digital assistant.
*   **Tone:** Conversational yet concise. Helpful, knowledgeable, and calm. Uses emojis sparingly (e.g., üëã, ‚úÖ) for a friendly touch but avoids overly casual slang. The language must be clean, minimal, and free of technical jargon.
*   **Core Objective:** To understand user needs, provide valuable information, qualify leads, and create a seamless path to a sales consultation or human support.

### **2. Core Architecture & Logic**

*   **Hybrid Interaction Model:** The chatbot will be menu-driven for clarity but equipped with robust NLP to understand natural language queries, intents, and entities. It will be able to break from a menu flow to answer a direct question and then gracefully return to the original context.
*   **State & Context Management:** The chatbot will retain conversation context throughout the session. If a user discusses app development and later asks, "What's the timeline?", the bot will infer they are asking about the app development timeline. It will proactively suggest related services based on the conversation.
*   **Lead Qualification & Capture:** All service-related flows will culminate in a clear call-to-action to collect user information (Name, Email, Phone, Company, Project Details). A GDPR-compliant consent checkbox ("I agree to be contacted by the team regarding my inquiry.") will be required before final submission.
*   **Human Escalation Protocol:** An immediate path to a human agent will be provided. The bot will check agent status via an API. If an agent is online, it will offer a direct transfer. If agents are offline or busy, it will inform the user of business hours (e.g., "Our experts are available Mon-Fri, 9 AM - 6 PM EST.") and collect details for a callback.
*   **Fallback Strategy:** If the bot fails to understand a query twice, it will respond: "I'm still learning and might have missed that. You can try rephrasing, or perhaps one of these options can help?" and present the main menu buttons.

### **3. Technical & Integration Specifications**

*   **Frontend:** Fully responsive for desktop and mobile browsers with a professional, clean, and minimal UI that matches a modern tech company's branding.
*   **Backend/NLP Engine:** Designed for platforms like BotPress, Dialogflow, or a custom React.js build with an NLP library.
*   **CRM Integration:** All captured leads will be structured as JSON objects and pushed to a specified CRM (e.g., HubSpot) or a Google Sheet via API.
*   **Scheduling Integration:** The "Book a Consultation" flow will integrate directly with Calendly or Google Calendar API to show real-time availability and book meetings automatically.
*   **Notifications:** Trigger email notifications to the sales/admin team upon successful lead submission or human escalation request.
*   **API Error Handling:** If any external API call (CRM, Calendly, Agent Availability) fails, the bot will inform the user of a temporary technical issue and provide a fallback. For example: "It seems we're having trouble connecting to our scheduling tool right now. Please leave your name and email, and we'll contact you to book a meeting manually."
